"""Sandman automatically generates a REST API from your existing database,
without you needing to tediously define the tables in typical ORM style. Simply
create a class for each table you want to expose in the API, give it's
associated database table, and off you go! The generated API essentially exposes
a completely new system based on your existing data, using HATEOAS."""
